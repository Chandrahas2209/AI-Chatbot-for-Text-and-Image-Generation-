# AI Chatbot for Text and Image Generation

This is an AI-powered chatbot that can generate text responses and images based on user input. The chatbot uses Hugging Face's GPT model for text generation and Clipdrop's API for text-to-image generation. Itâ€™s built using Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface.

## Features
- **Text Generation**: Ask anything or describe a prompt, and the bot will generate a text-based response.
- **Image Generation**: Ask the bot to generate an image by describing it, and it will use the Clipdrop API to generate and display the image.
- **Chat History**: The conversation is saved in the session, allowing the chatbot to maintain context and refer back to previous messages.
